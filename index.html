            <p> 
                Some people have it all figured out. The know what they want to be when they grow up. I am not that person. I am an explorer, a tinkerer, a woman that constantly needs to her mind nourished and pushed the limits. The path that I am on has taken me from customer service to management,to social media, to project management and now a student of code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is unlike any path I have been on before. This is a path of creativity, of logic and one of much patience and practice. When I say my mind needs a challenge, this is it. Coding is not easy for. It takes a lof time and persistence and that is my rocky road. I look forward to the future and see myself always in learning mode and that is how I continue to grow.
